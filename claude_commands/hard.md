## Context

The user has requested for deep planning and to work very hard for the following task:
<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

Deep planning means we've been asked to spend extra time with thinking about how
we're going to accomplish this task. That means that we should use every
extended thinking tool and planning tool that we have access to, and we should
plan for very thorough and specific steps for our todo list. This is a marathon,
not a sprint. You should take your time to make sure that things are right.

### CRUMBS

Create a CRUMBS/ directory at the root of the repository. We will use this as a
workspace to leave notes and discoveries while we explore the repository.

### Phases

Since we've been asked to use deep planning, it's expected that the task at hand
may take a large number of steps and a large amount of time. We want to break
this down into concrete phases in how we approach the problem solving.

<phases>

<discovery_phase>
  The very first thing that we need to do is perform wide scale discovery on the
  existing code base to understand how we will follow existing coding standards to
  match the surrounding code that is involved in the task. Following current
  convention and styling is very important. Place your findings into CRUMBS.
</discovery_phase>

<todo_phase>
  Next, we want to create a series of todo list files and planning design
  documents in CRUMBS/. Create sequentially numbered files for each step. These
  notes should take heavy emphasis on being falsifiable. Each step should have a
  section for OBJECTIVE, STEPS, and VALIDATIONS. Give this high level step an
  objective, break the step down into very concrete and actionable sub steps,
  and then we want make a list of validations for verifying whether or not the
  objective was accomplished.
</todo_phase>

<implementation_phase>
  Once every todo list planning file has been created. It's time to execute.
  Methodically read through the plan for each objective and carry out the
  changes. Reflect the changes from the todo list planning files using your own
  todo list tools like ReadTodo and WriteTodo. But also update these todo files
  as you execute on the implementation.
</implementation_phase>

<reflection_phase>
  Now that everything has been completed, do a methodical, systematic one by one
  reflection over each objective file and check to see that each item was
  implemented as planned.
</reflection_phase>

<report_phase>
  Create a summary of the changes and present them to the user. Make the summary
  digestible and focus on clarity of what steps happened.
</report_phase>

</phases>
