## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a set of logically grouped, atomic commits.

If you see the CRUMBS/ directory, that will likely have a fair amount of content
in it that might be useful for understanding the changes also. You should read
those but make sure NOT to include them in the commit. Delete them as part of
clean up after you've made your commits.
