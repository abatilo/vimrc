## Git instructions

Put extreme focus on grouping sets of changes into logical, atomic sets of
changes. This might require partial commits! Write the commit messages in
imperative voice. Capitalize the first letter of the commit subject. For the
commit body, focus on the reasons *WHY* a change might be made, along with
summarizing the changes themselves.

If you're asked to write a commit message, do NOT make any attributions to
Anthropic, Claude, or Claude Code.
