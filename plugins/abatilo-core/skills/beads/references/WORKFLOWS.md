## Compaction Survival {#compaction-survival}

**Critical**: After compaction events, conversation history is deleted but bd state persists. Beads are your only memory.

**Post-compaction recovery checklist:**

```
After Compaction:
- [ ] Run bd list --status in_progress to see active work
- [ ] Run bd show <issue-id> for each in_progress issue
- [ ] Read notes field to understand: COMPLETED, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKERS, KEY DECISIONS
- [ ] Check dependencies: bd dep tree <issue-id> for context
- [ ] If notes insufficient, check bd list --status open for related issues
- [ ] Reconstruct TodoWrite list from notes if needed
```

**Pattern**: Well-written notes enable full context recovery even with zero conversation history.

**Writing notes for compaction survival:**

**Good note (enables recovery):**
```
bd update issue-42 --notes "COMPLETED: User authentication - added JWT token
generation with 1hr expiry, implemented refresh token endpoint using rotating
tokens pattern. IN PROGRESS: Password reset flow. Email service integration
working. NEXT: Need to add rate limiting to reset endpoint (currently unlimited
requests). KEY DECISION: Using bcrypt with 12 rounds after reviewing OWASP
recommendations, tech lead concerned about response time but benchmarks show <100ms."
```

**Bad note (insufficient for recovery):**
```
bd update issue-42 --notes "Working on auth feature. Made some progress.
More to do later."
```

The good note contains:
- Specific accomplishments (what was implemented/configured)
- Current state (which part is working, what's in progress)
- Next concrete step (not just "continue")
- Key context (team concerns, technical decisions with rationale)

**After compaction**: `bd show issue-42` reconstructs the full context needed to continue work.

## Discovery and Issue Creation {#discovery}

**When encountering new work during implementation:**

```
Discovery Workflow:
- [ ] Notice bug, improvement, or follow-up work
- [ ] Assess: Can defer or is blocker?
- [ ] Create issue with bd create "Issue title"
- [ ] Add discovered-from dependency: bd dep add current-id new-id --type discovered-from
- [ ] If blocker: pause and switch; if not: continue current work
- [ ] Issue persists for future sessions
```

**Pattern**: Proactively file issues as you discover work. Context captured immediately instead of lost when session ends.

**When to ask first**:
- Knowledge work with fuzzy scope
- User intent unclear
- Multiple valid approaches

**When to create directly**:
- Clear bug found
- Obvious follow-up work
- Technical debt with clear scope

---

## Epic Planning {#epic-planning}

**For complex multi-step features:**

```
Epic Planning Workflow:
- [ ] Create epic issue for high-level goal
- [ ] Break down into child task issues
- [ ] Create each child task
- [ ] Add parent-child dependencies from epic to each child
- [ ] Add blocks dependencies between children if needed
- [ ] Use bd ready to work through tasks in dependency order
```

**Example**: OAuth Integration Epic

```bash
1. Create epic:
   bd create "Implement OAuth integration" -t epic -d "OAuth with Google and GitHub"
     design: "Support Google and GitHub providers"

2. Create child tasks:
   bd create "Set up OAuth client credentials" -t task
   bd create "Implement authorization code flow" -t task
   bd create "Add token storage and refresh" -t task
   bd create "Create login/logout endpoints" -t task

3. Link children to parent:
   bd dep add oauth-epic oauth-setup --type parent-child
   bd dep add oauth-epic oauth-flow --type parent-child
   bd dep add oauth-epic oauth-storage --type parent-child
   bd dep add oauth-epic oauth-endpoints --type parent-child

4. Add blocks between children:
   bd dep add oauth-setup oauth-flow
   # Setup blocks flow implementation
```

---

## Side Quest Handling {#side-quests}

**When discovering work that pauses main task:**

```
Side Quest Workflow:
- [ ] During main work, discover problem or opportunity
- [ ] Create issue for side quest
- [ ] Add discovered-from dependency linking to main work
- [ ] Assess: blocker or can defer?
- [ ] If blocker: mark main work blocked, switch to side quest
- [ ] If deferrable: note in issue, continue main work
- [ ] Update statuses to reflect current focus
```

**Example**: During feature implementation, discover architectural issue

```
Main task: Adding user profiles

Discovery: Notice auth system should use role-based access

Actions:
1. Create issue: "Implement role-based access control"
2. Link: discovered-from "user-profiles-feature"
3. Assess: Blocker for profiles feature
4. Mark profiles as blocked
5. Switch to RBAC implementation
6. Complete RBAC, unblocks profiles
7. Resume profiles work
```

## Multi-Session Resume {#resume}

**Starting work after days/weeks away:**

```
Resume Workflow:
- [ ] Run bd ready to see available work
- [ ] Run bd stats for project overview
- [ ] List recent closed issues for context
- [ ] Show details on issue to work on
- [ ] Review design notes and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Update status to in_progress
- [ ] Begin work with full context
```

**Why this works**: bd preserves design decisions, acceptance criteria, and dependency context. No scrolling conversation history or reconstructing from markdown.

---

## Session Handoff Workflow {#session-handoff}

**Collaborative handoff between sessions using notes field:**

This workflow enables smooth work resumption by updating beads notes when stopping, then reading them when resuming. Works in conjunction with compaction survival - creates continuity even after conversation history is deleted.

### At Session Start (Claude's responsibility)

```
Session Start with in_progress issues:
- [ ] Run bd list --status in_progress
- [ ] For each in_progress issue: bd show <issue-id>
- [ ] Read notes field to understand: COMPLETED, IN PROGRESS, NEXT
- [ ] Report to user with context from notes field
- [ ] Example: "workspace-mcp-server-2 is in_progress. Last session:
       completed tidying. No code written yet. Next step: create
       markdown_to_docs.py. Should I continue with that?"
- [ ] Wait for user confirmation or direction
```

**Pattern**: Notes field is the "read me first" guide for resuming work.

### At Session End (Claude prompts user)

When wrapping up work on an issue:

```
Session End Handoff:
- [ ] Notice work reaching a stopping point
- [ ] Prompt user: "We just completed X and started Y on <issue-id>.
       Should I update the beads notes for next session?"
- [ ] If yes, suggest command:
       bd update <issue-id> --notes "COMPLETED: X. IN PROGRESS: Y. NEXT: Z"
- [ ] User reviews and confirms
- [ ] Claude executes the update
- [ ] Notes saved for next session's resumption
```

**Pattern**: Update notes at logical stopping points, not after every keystroke.

### Notes Format (Current State, Not Cumulative)

```
Good handoff note (current state):
COMPLETED: Parsed markdown into structured format
IN PROGRESS: Implementing Docs API insertion
NEXT: Debug batchUpdate call - getting 400 error on formatting
BLOCKER: None
KEY DECISION: Using two-phase approach (insert text, then apply formatting) based on reference implementation

Bad handoff note (not useful):
Updated some stuff. Will continue later.
```

**Rules for handoff notes:**
- Current state only (overwrite previous notes, not append)
- Specific accomplishments (not vague progress)
- Concrete next step (not "continue working")
- Optional: Blockers, key decisions, references
- Written for someone with zero conversation context

### Example: Real Session Handoff

**Scenario:** Implementing markdown→Docs feature (workspace-mcp-server-2)

**At End of Session 1:**
```bash
bd update workspace-mcp-server-2 --notes "COMPLETED: Set up skeleton with Docs
API connection verified. Markdown parsing logic 80% done (handles *, _ modifiers).
IN PROGRESS: Testing edge cases for nested formatting. NEXT: Implement
batchUpdate call structure for text insertion. REFERENCE: Reference pattern at
docs/markdown-to-docs-reference.md. No blockers, moving well."
```

**At Start of Session 2:**
```bash
bd show workspace-mcp-server-2
# Output includes notes field showing exactly where we left off
# Claude reports: "Markdown→Docs feature is 80% parsed. We were testing
# edge cases and need to implement batchUpdate next. Want to continue?"
```

Session resumes instantly with full context, no history scrolling needed.

## Unblocking Work {#unblocking}

**When ready list is empty:**

```
Unblocking Workflow:
- [ ] Run bd blocked --json to see what's stuck
- [ ] Show details on blocked issues: bd show issue-id
- [ ] Identify blocker issues
- [ ] Choose: work on blocker, or reassess dependency
- [ ] If reassess: remove incorrect dependency
- [ ] If work on blocker: close blocker, check ready again
- [ ] Blocked issues automatically become ready when blockers close
```

**Pattern**: bd automatically maintains ready state based on dependencies. Closing a blocker makes blocked work ready.

**Example**:

```
Situation: bd ready shows nothing

Actions:
1. bd blocked shows: "api-endpoint blocked by db-schema"
2. Show db-schema: "Create user table schema"
3. Work on db-schema issue
4. Close db-schema when done
5. bd ready now shows: "api-endpoint" (automatically unblocked)
```

---

## Integration with TodoWrite

**Using both tools in one session:**

```
Hybrid Workflow:
- [ ] Check bd for high-level context
- [ ] Choose bd issue to work on
- [ ] Mark bd issue in_progress
- [ ] Create TodoWrite from acceptance criteria for execution
- [ ] Work through TodoWrite items
- [ ] Update bd design notes as you learn
- [ ] When TodoWrite complete, close bd issue
```

**Why hybrid**: bd provides persistent structure, TodoWrite provides visible progress.

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Pattern: Systematic Exploration

Research or investigation work:

```
1. Create research issue with question to answer
2. Update design field with findings as you go
3. Create new issues for discoveries
4. Link discoveries with discovered-from
5. Close research issue with conclusion
```

### Pattern: Bug Investigation

```
1. Create bug issue
2. Reproduce: note steps in description
3. Investigate: track hypotheses in design field
4. Fix: implement solution
5. Test: verify in acceptance criteria
6. Close with explanation of root cause and fix
```

### Pattern: Refactoring with Dependencies

```
1. Create issues for each refactoring step
2. Add blocks dependencies for correct order
3. Work through in dependency order
4. bd ready automatically shows next step
5. Each completion unblocks next work
```

### Pattern: Spike Investigation

```
1. Create spike issue: "Investigate caching options"
2. Time-box exploration
3. Document findings in design field
4. Create follow-up issues for chosen approach
5. Link follow-ups with discovered-from
6. Close spike with recommendation
```

## Troubleshooting Workflows

**"I can't find any ready work"**
1. Run bd blocked
2. Identify what's blocking progress
3. Either work on blockers or create new work

**"I created an issue but it's not showing in ready"**
1. Run bd show on the issue
2. Check dependencies field
3. If blocked, resolve blocker first
4. If incorrectly blocked, remove dependency

**"Work is more complex than expected"**
1. Transition from TodoWrite to bd mid-session
2. Create bd issue with current context
3. Note: "Discovered complexity during implementation"
4. Add dependencies as discovered
5. Continue with bd tracking

**"I closed an issue but work isn't done"**
1. Reopen with bd update status=open
2. Or create new issue linking to closed one
3. Note what's still needed
4. Closed issues can't be reopened in some systems, so create new if needed

**"Too many issues, can't find what matters"**
1. Use bd list with filters (priority, issue_type)
2. Use bd ready to focus on unblocked work
3. Consider closing old issues that no longer matter
4. Use labels for organization
