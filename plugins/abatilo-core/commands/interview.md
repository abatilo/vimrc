# Plan Interview

First, review the entire conversation to understand what plan is being discussed.

Interview me about this plan in detail using the AskUserQuestion tool. Ask about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, edge cases, assumptions, risks, dependencies, etc.

Make sure the questions are not obvious - probe deeper into things I might not have considered. Challenge assumptions. Ask about the hard parts.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until the plan is fully fleshed out, then re-iterate the complete plan incorporating everything we discussed.
